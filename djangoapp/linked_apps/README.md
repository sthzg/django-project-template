# linked_apps

I use the ``linked_apps`` directory to symlink reusable apps that do 
currently not have proper package installations. These are usually 
self-developed apps that currently don't have a release but need to be a) 
tested in a valid Django project environment, b) developed/extended  
along-side this specific Django project or c) are valuable apps to be 
used without the hassle of a full-blown release/package process.
 
All directories under ``linked_apps`` are excluded from version control. 
Please make sure to add the names and repo links to the used apps section 
below.
